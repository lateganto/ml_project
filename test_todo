TESTS

TEST 1: DONE - good policy but car follows right lane. To check if CTE is to high in reward function
STATS = "./stats/test-1.csv"
MODEL = "./save_model/model_test-1.h5"
MODEL_TYPE = 1
ACTION_SPACE = 15 - ONLY STEERING
LANE_DETECTION_TYPE = 1
REWARD: NO THROTTLE/ NO STEERING/ ONLY CTE
CTE_MAX_ERR = 3.5
CTE_LIMIT = 3.0

TEST 2: DONE - good policy but car has too variable steering - try to add penalty for "hard" steering
STATS = "./stats/test-2.csv"
MODEL = "./save_model/model_test-2.h5"
MODEL_TYPE = 1
ACTION_SPACE = 15 - ONLY STEERING
LANE_DETECTION_TYPE = 2
REWARD: NO THROTTLE/ NO STEERING/ ONLY CTE
CTE_MAX_ERR = 3.5
CTE_LIMIT = 3.0

TEST 3: DONE - bad policy - car steering is unstable and fails after few steps
             - used custom_cnn model: bad idea
STATS = "./stats/test-3.csv"
MODEL = "./save_model/model_test-3.h5"
MODEL_TYPE = 2
ACTION_SPACE = 15 - ONLY STEERING
LANE_DETECTION_TYPE = 3
REWARD: NO THROTTLE/ NO STEERING/ ONLY CTE
CTE_MAX_ERR = 3.5
CTE_LIMIT = 3.0

TEST 4: DONE - replaces TEST 1 where car follows right white lane - GOOD POLICY, try to improve hard steering changes
             - stopped after 93 episodes due to 2000 steps limit reached most of times at the end
STATS = "./stats/test-4.csv"
MODEL = "./save_model/model_test-4.h5"

TEST 8: DONE LANE_DETECTION_TYPE = 3 with regression (custom_model)
STATS = "./stats/test-8.csv"
MODEL = "./save_model/model_test-8.h5"
MODEL_TYPE = 2
ACTION_SPACE = 15 - ONLY STEERING
